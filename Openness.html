          I know we have a history na nagsinungaling ako about playing because I
          don't want you to know that I'm playing. But I actually removed my
          playing habits kasi nga I'm not bored anymore and ayon, I really just
          focused on building a future with you.

          Anyways, another gift I have for you is openness. Not just being open
          about everything but also being truthful to everything. I know how
          important honesty to you, love that's why for the past 7 months,
          before, I promised myself na kung mag mimeet ulit tayo I will always
          be honest to you kahit pa alam kong ikakagalit mo. I grew and matured
          so much in 7 months because of you. I realized that what I lacked
          before was being open to the truth, it shouldn't matter if magagalit
          ka man or what but what's important is how I can be accountable with
          what I've done and that is my gift to you being open to everything.
        </p>

        <p className="card-text fs-5">
          I love you so much love and probably ang hindi ko lang madalas i oopen
          sayo is yung mga surprises na minsan pa nasasabi ko kasi diko kayang
          mag tago sayo or what hahahah. Ang ewan kasi na eexcite ako and ending
          nasasabi ko bigla mga surprises ko sayo hahahah. Anyways ayon, love, I
          will always be open and honest to you so you don't have to worry
          because I will always be honest to you kahit pa alam kong ikakagalit
          mo I will be truthful kasi I know trust is important in our
          relationship okay love? I love you so much and I love you always,
          love.
