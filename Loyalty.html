          I may not have much but the first thing I can give you is
          <strong>"Loyalty"</strong>. In a world full of unfaithful people, a
          world where cheating is a norm, where having multiple lovers is
          nothing. I am here to love you and you alone, even if we fight, argue
          and even if we have so many misunderstandings. I will never ever cheat
          on you and you will be the only one in my heart no one else will get
          or steal my heart ever okay? So rest assured because I am only yours.
          The bible says:
        </p>

        <hr />
        <p className="card-text fs-5">
          Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck,
          write them on the tablet of your heart.
        </p>
        <p className="card-text fs-1 text-center">
          <strong><i>Proverbs 3:3</i></strong>
        </p>
        <hr />

        <p className="card-text fs-5 pt-4">
          Kaya love, you don't have to worry kasi kahit pa may pinupuntahan pa
          ako, I will never be tempted, I will never be attracted to anybody
          else because I can only be attracted by you and you alone okay? Ikaw
          at ikaw lang ang mahal ko at mamahalin ko. Always remember that our
          love and faithfulness will never leave each other okay? I know that
          God is always there and will always be with us. Basta let us never
          forget how much we love each other okay?
        </p>

        <p className="card-text fs-5">
          Ikaw at ikaw ang mamahalin ko, love. Wala akong pake kung mag LDR man
          ulit tayo or kung ano pa. I will always love you not because of the
          kisses, hugs or kung ano pa, love. I love you and I am faithful to you
          because I love you and that alone is enough to be faithful. Hinding
          hindi ako mag hahanap ng iba kaya what I can also give you na kasama
          ng loyalty is peace and assurance... Peace na alam mong ikaw lang ang
          mamahalin ko lagi, ang gusto kong halikan lagi, ang gusto kong
          pakasalan at makasama habang buhay... Assurance na ikaw at ikaw lang
          ang aking mamahalin pang habang buhay at wala nang iba, love. I love
          you so much and I love you always. I love you, love.
        </p>
