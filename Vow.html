        <p className="card-text fs-5">
          Vows are religous and as we are in a relationship planning to have a
          future together. So, I will give you gifts of my vows that I will love
          you, I will protect you, I will take care of you, I will always be
          there for you, I will be there if you're happy, sad, or even mad, I
          will be there to comfort you in times you need me, I will be there
          always for you, love. My vow for you aren't just words to say
          something sweet but I know that words are powerful and I will be the
          man you'll ever need okay love? I will love you always.
        </p>

        <p className="card-text fs-5 pt-4">
          Alam mo ba love that when I say "I love you always" it's like my
          everyday vow to you. Wala pang araw na kahit nag aaway tayo
          sinasabihan padin kita ng "I love you always" not just because I love
          you, but because what I mean is I love you even if you're mad, I love
          you even if you're not in the mood, I love you when you're clingy and
          demanding hahhaha, i love you even when we're not talking to each
          other. I admin loving you sometimes is hard and challenging but it's
          normal when it comes to love. Minsan naiinis tayo sa isa't isa, na
          bubwisit tayo sa isat isa, pero we still love each other at hinding
          hindi mawawala at maaalis yon. Even if right now hindi pa tayo mag
          asawa, I vow to love you forever and ever. I will always be here for
          you, I will always take care of you and I will always love you
          unconditionally... It means kahit walang kiss, hugs or cuddles, I will
          always love you okay? hahhaha. I love you, love.
        </p>

        <p className="card-text fs-5 pt-4">
          Although these are just mere words, I know that words are more
          powerful than any other thing because words can be hurtful but words
          can also heal. So, love, trust me when I say that I will always love
          you in bad times and in good times, even if distance grew us apart, I
          will always love you, I know we can do this and I know that everything
          will be worth it one day kung saan dadalawa nalang tayo sa iisang
          bahay, nag haharutan hahhaa. And one day, we'll achieve that okay
          love? I love you so much, love.
        </p>
